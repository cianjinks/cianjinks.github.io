You were presented with a simple binary that when ran produced the following output:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Locked_Out1.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Locked_Out1.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>As is customary my first thought was to test for a buffer overflow vulnerability by filling the input with a large amount of letters, but alas this did not cause any problems as I had hoped. (Little did I know I made a small mistake here that I wouldn’t notice until after the competition had concluded)</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Locked_Out2.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Locked_Out2.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>I knew the flag was likely in the binary and so my next idea was to simply try the “strings” command and grep for “HackTrinity” but once again this produced nothing. It seemed the flag was encrypted somehow within the binary. Finally I decided it was time to open up the binary in a disassembler for which I chose gdb as it was already installed on my ubuntu vm. After disassembling main I immediately noticed some functions which had proper names retrieved from the binary, most notably “enc_password”, “decrypt”, “print_flag” and “strcmp”. Taking a look at the instruction calls it became clear that the binary encrypts the password taken in and then compares it against a decrypted password using the string compare function in C.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Locked_Out3.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Locked_Out3.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>My first thought was to somehow just modify the jump instruction at “0x0000000040001475” to always jump no matter the result of the string compare but after a bit of research this turned out to not be as easy as I thought it would be. I discovered that a jump instruction in x86 is encoded based on the offset it wishes to jump to and this made creating a new jump instruction a bit more difficult then I intended, however I would have likely tried had my next idea not worked out.</p><p>Instead I chose to look into how the strcmp function worked in C by visiting its man page. As can be seen below it returns zero when the strings match.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Locked_Out4.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Locked_Out4.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>After a little bit more research I discovered that the “test eax,eax” instruction after the strcmp function in the disassembled main is in fact where the program checks the result of strcmp. Thus I simply had to set a breakpoint at that instruction, modify eax to 0 and then continue. (Note that rax is eax on 64bit systems)</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Locked_Out5.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Locked_Out5.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>Bam! We have the flag:</p><blockquote class="prompt-info"><div><p><strong>Flag:</strong> HackTrinity{h0w_cou1d_y0u_th3y_trusted_y0u}</p></div></blockquote><p>As for the mistake I mentioned above, I later realised that the binary did infact have a buffer overflow vulnerability. It just happened to have a large-ish buffer of 256 characters so I never realised it. This knowledge would have allowed me to solve the next challenge in this cateogry, Locked Out 2, easily enough as well.</p><h3 id="web---casual"><span class="mr-2">Web - Casual</span><a href="#web---casual" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>This challenge brings you to a website which has a simple browser version of the popular game 2048. The first thing I made sure to do, after quickly glancing around the website, was to open up the chrome developer console and check out the website’s source. I spent quite a while searching around the javascript source code for the game for any potential clues as to the direction of the flag. I was thinking all I had to do was cheat the game and win and the flag would be revealed but I found nothing to indicate this was the case. After a frustrating amount of time searching, which was entirely my fault, I eventually found the flag commented out on the very last line of the “main.css” file. In hindsight I should have just tried searching every file for the keyword “HackTrinity” at the very beginning.</p><blockquote class="prompt-info"><div><p><strong>Flag:</strong> HackTrinity{y0u_hav3_to_se4rch_f0r_it}</p></div></blockquote><h3 id="recon---copycats"><span class="mr-2">Recon - CopyCats</span><a href="#recon---copycats" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>This question asked for the handle of a fake Hack Trinity phishing page that someone set up for the 2019 competition to try and steal the flags for that year’s challenges (the flag was in non standard format). I didn’t participate in the 2019 competition so I would not have known the answer to this from the time. My initial thought was to head on over to the Hack Trinity twitter page and scroll all the way back to last year in search of a potential tweet about the phishing site. Sadly, I was unable to find anything of value after quite a bit of searching.</p><p>I reasoned I should probably take a much broader approach and began by googling types of phishing attacks. I quickly came to know the idea of typosquatting. This is when a person registers a url with a very slight difference to the real url of a website and tries to use it to fool a user into believing it is said website. This is an attack I already knew of but had never heard the name. After some more quick google searching I came across this tool called dnstwist which would scan for many potential typosquatted versions of a websites url. Upon installing and running it the results came back positive:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Copy_Cats1.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Copy_Cats1.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>As can be seen the tool detected a single registered typosquatted version of the Hack Trinity domain. I was sure I had my flag and so I copied the domain name and threw it into the flag box only to receive:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Copy_Cats2.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Copy_Cats2.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>I was baffled. I was sure I had the right answer but alas this was not the case. After a little more mindless attempts to make sure I had not made some silly mistake I ultimtely gave up and moved on to other challenges. It was not until the next day that I gave this challenge a go again. With a fresh start I decided to recheck the Hack Trinity twitter page for any clues I may have missed the previous day. This time however I made sure to scroll through their replies to tweets as well. Here I found a reply they made to a tweet referencing a fake Hack Trinity twitter page that was created to try and steal some of the flags from people. Suddenly I realised my major mistake. I had assumed that the challenge was looking for a phishing <em>website</em> but in fact it had asked for their <em>handle</em>, the twitter handle of this fake twitter page.</p><blockquote class="prompt-info"><div><p><strong>Flag:</strong> @HackTrinity19</p></div></blockquote><h3 id="forensics---panic"><span class="mr-2">Forensics - Panic</span><a href="#forensics---panic" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>This challenge gave you minimal information and a simple file called “bread.pdf”. Upon opening it there is only one page with a picture of the empty bread isles in supermarkets due to coronavirus which I thought was a good homage to the current virus that shall not be named situation. I never really had any experience with the pdf format as a whole and so I began by searching for pdf virus analysis blogs online where I thought maybe some security researchers would make their own write ups on malicious pdf documents. My time spent searching led me to a tool called <a href="https://github.com/jesparza/peepdf">peepdf</a> which is great for browsing the structure of a pdf document. After opening up “bread.pdf” in peepdf it gave me some information about the file such as the number of objects. It even helpfully labelled a suspicious element in object 8, however sadly there were no suspicious javascript elements as I had hoped there would be.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Panic1.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Panic1.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>I was quick to open up this suspicious object using the object command but all I got back was some giberrish I didn’t know what to do with so before investigating that further I checked out every other object as well. Ultimately I only found one other object of note which was object 2 as it also had some gibberish hidden within it.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Panic2.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Panic2.JPG" data-proofer-ignore> <img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Panic3.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Panic3.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>I noted that the object 2 data was labelled as flate decode which I had heard of before as a compression algorithm. After a bit of messing around I realised the data is already decompressed as I was using the “object” command instead of “rawobject”. The data still looked like gibberish to me though so I decided to start looking up some snippets of the string. A search online for “/Im4 Do Q” led me to realise ths data was in fact encoded text. As it turns out PDF’s have their own way of encoding text into a document. I began researching this encoding to see if I could write a simple program to reverse it but after a bit of reading it became clear that such a task would not be so easy. After a little while of deliberating I realised I could probably use someone else’s tool to extract the strings from a pdf document. After finding <a href="https://www.extractpdf.com/">this website</a> it gave me the flag.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Panic4.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Panic4.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><blockquote class="prompt-info"><div><p><strong>Flag:</strong> HackTrinity{th3_f1ag_supply_cha1ns_ar3_str0ng}</p></div></blockquote><p>(I ended up solving this in quite the roundabout way as you can see but hopefully it helped you learn something about the pdf file format)</p><h3 id="forensics---out-of-office"><span class="mr-2">Forensics - Out of Office</span><a href="#forensics---out-of-office" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>Similar to “Panic” you were given a “hacked.docx” file and told to investigate it. It didn’t take me long to discover that a docx file can actually be unzipped by most decompression tools therefore I used 7zip and was greeted by a handful of files and folders.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Out_Of_Office1.JPG" alt="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Out_Of_Office1.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>After some searching around I opened one of the xml files called “item1.xml” and found the following pastebin url:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/post/HackTrinity/HackTrinity_Out_Of_Office2.JPG" alt="HackTrinity_Out_Of_Office1.JPG" data-proofer-ignore></p><p><em>However</em> after quickly copying it over to my browser it returned a page not found error? I was left stumped for a short while before thinking of a website I had used many a time in the past called the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> which stores archived versions of webpages. Sure enough there was one snapshot saved of this pastebin url and bingo some code was hidden within:</p><div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="code-header"> <span data-label-text="Python"><i class="fas fa-code small"></i></span> <button aria-label="copy" data-title-succeed="Copied!"><i class="far fa-clipboard"></i></button></div><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>From the looks of things it opens a reverse shell connection on port 1337 to your machine. I was wondering where to go from here and thought maybe I should listen for traffic on said port or something along those lines when I realised that there was no way this code ever ran as the pastebin url was invalid. That’s when I remembered the base64 encoded string at the bottom. When decoded it in fact returns the flag.</p><blockquote class="prompt-info"><div><p><strong>Flag:</strong> HackTrinity{AlW@y5<em>C13aN_Up</em>@ft3r_y0uR_H@ck5}</p></div></blockquote><h2 id="the-end"><span class="mr-2">The End</span><a href="#the-end" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>That’s it for all the challenges I was able to solve this time around! I attempted many others but never quie finished them, although I came quite close on some :( . Ultimately I ended up placing 52nd which I’m pretty happy with although I definitely think I can do better in next year’s. I hope this write up was informative in some way or atleast will inspire others to try out CTFs as they really are quite a lot of fun. One problem I have is a feeling this write up wasn’t worded overly well and comes across as some kind of first person report rather then a fun read, therefore I vow to come back and try fix that some time in the future. I hope you enjoyed and thanks for reading :D</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/old/'>Old</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/ctf/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >ctf</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HackTrinity CTF Write Up - Cian Jinks&amp;url=https://cianjinks.github.io//posts/hacktrinity-ctf-write-up/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=HackTrinity CTF Write Up - Cian Jinks&amp;u=https://cianjinks.github.io//posts/hacktrinity-ctf-write-up/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://t.me/share/url?url=https://cianjinks.github.io//posts/hacktrinity-ctf-write-up/&amp;text=HackTrinity CTF Write Up - Cian Jinks" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" data-title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><div class="panel-heading">Recently Updated</div><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/cmake-project-graphics-programming/">Creating a CMake Project for cross platform graphics programming with OpenGL</a><li><a href="/posts/opengl-tutorial-batch-rendering-and-dynamic-vbos/">OpenGL Tutorial - Batch Rendering and Dynamic VBOs</a><li><a href="/posts/opengl-tutorial-visualizing-the-mandelbrot-set-fractal-part-1-of-2/">OpenGL Tutorial - Visualizing the Mandelbrot Set Fractal - Part 1 of 2</a><li><a href="/posts/tutorial-using-maven-and-intellij-for-opengl-projects/">Tutorial - Using Maven and IntelliJ for OpenGL Projects</a><li><a href="/posts/opengl-tutorial-visualizing-the-mandelbrot-set-part-2-of-2/">OpenGL Tutorial - Visualizing the Mandelbrot Set Fractal - Part 2 of 2</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"><div class="panel-heading">Trending Tags</div><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/opengl/">opengl</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/tutorial/">tutorial</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/lwjgl/">lwjgl</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/fractal/">fractal</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/cmake/">cmake</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/ctf/">ctf</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/imgui/">imgui</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/maven/">maven</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"><div class="panel-heading pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</div><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="tail-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/opengl-tutorial-visualizing-the-mandelbrot-set-fractal-part-1-of-2/"><div class="card-body"> <em class="timeago small" data-ts="1589630400" > 2020-05-16 </em><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>OpenGL Tutorial - Visualizing the Mandelbrot Set Fractal - Part 1 of 2</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> Welcome to my first blog post/tutorial of many I hope to create on the topic of computer graphics programming using OpenGL.
